# 🌌 The DedeKorkutNLP Manifesto: Wisdom in the Age of Silicon

> *"Geçmişin hikmeti, geleceğin zekasıyla buluşuyor."*

## The Philosophy

In the era of Artificial Intelligence, language is no longer just a means of communication; it is raw material, code, and consciousness. However, raw intelligence without wisdom is merely calculation. 

**DedeKorkutNLP** is not just a library. It is a bridge. 

It bridges the gap between the chaotic, rich, and agglutinative nature of the **Turkish language** and the structured, vector-based world of **Machine Learning**. It takes inspiration from **Dede Korkut**, the eternal storyteller who wove the values, fears, and hopes of a nation into epic tales.

We believe that:
1.  **Code is Literature**: Every function should tell a story. Every variable should have a purpose.
2.  **Roots Matter**: To build the future of Turkish AI, we must understand the linguistic roots of the past.
3.  **Wisdom > Intelligence**: An AI can generate text, but can it generate *meaning*? We strive for the latter.

## The Mission

Our mission is to empower Turkish NLP researchers and developers with tools that are as **robust as a fortress** and as **fluid as a poem**. We are building a digital *Oğuzname*—a repository of knowledge that will serve generations of digital bards.

## The Code of Honor

Contributors to this project are not just coders; they are **Digital Ozanlar** (Bards).
- We write code that is clean, documented, and respectful of the user's time.
- We do not just solve errors; we heal the data.
- We build for the community, openly and fearlessly.
